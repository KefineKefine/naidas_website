                        <p>I've been a writer since my preschool
                            days. Over the years I've made several
                            stories, from whacky and insensible ones
                            to complicated and grand ones. I started
                            not with words, but with comics drawn on
                            used up school notebooks. From there, I've
                            created a franchise that I still work on
                            to this very day.

                        <p>I absolutely love drawing.
                            It's practically one of the biggest foundations
                            of all my hobbies, and without it, I would be at
                            a disadvantage. I can do traditional art and
                            digital art, and I'm moderate at pixel art.

                        <p>In my early highschool years I got into animation
                            - specifically using FlipaClip -
                            so that I could bring my stories to life.
                            I haven't animated anything big recently, but I've
                            animated a few trailers and one episode of a series
                            I called "Experiment 10-T".

                        <p>I'm a Godot Game Developer. I was inspired to
                            become a developer because of games like
                            Minecraft and LBP3 that encouraged creativity.
                            I was inspired to bring my stories to life through
                            video games. And, hey, it's REALLY fun.

                        <p>I'm a midi artist, lyricist, singer, guitarist, and
                            pianist. Most of the songs I've composed are ballads.
                            I sing alot about my feelings and my mood at the current
                            moment of composition.
                            If they're not songs, they're mostly soundtracks of
                            personal projects. I use to use Online Sequencer, but
                            now I use FLStudio.
